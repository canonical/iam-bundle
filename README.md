# This repo/template is archived.

The initial purpose of this template was to test out possible alternatives to the `charmcraft init`
defaults. Since this [PR](https://github.com/canonical/charmcraft/pull/932), the `charmcraft init`
now supports 3 different profiles, all of which come with the same directory structure/layout as
this template.

Please use that in the future, and file any issues at https://github.com/canonical/charmcraft/issues/
